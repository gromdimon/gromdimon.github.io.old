If you\u0026rsquo;re here, you might already know me from my writings on Medium , where I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my insights and explorations in the realms of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. My name is Dzmitry Hramyka, a software engineer with a penchant for the intricate dance between technology and life\u0026rsquo;s myriad facets.\nOver the years, my professional and personal journey has taken me through various landscapes of learning and growth. From delving deep into the complexities of programming languages and frameworks to exploring the promising intersections of AI and bioinformatics, each step has been a chapter in a larger story of discovery. But beyond the technicalities and the achievements, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the most fulfilling experiences come from the connections we make and the stories we share.\nThis blog is an extension of that realization. Moving from Medium to this personal space, I aim to create a more intimate platform for sharing not just knowledge and expertise, but also reflections on the quieter, often overlooked moments that shape us as individuals and as a community.\nAs a friendly and peaceful soul, I believe in the power of positivity and the importance of fostering an environment where ideas can be exchanged freely and with respect. Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll find articles ranging from in-depth technical tutorials and analyses to personal anecdotes and musings on life. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a fellow software engineer, someone curious about AI and Bioinformatics, or simply here for the stories, I hope to offer something of value to you.\nThis blog is not just about sharing my experiences and thoughts; it\u0026rsquo;s about creating a dialogue. I encourage you to share your perspectives, challenge ideas (respectfully), and engage in discussions that broaden our horizons. Together, we can build a community that values growth, learning, and the sheer joy of discovery.\nSo, what is this blog about? It\u0026rsquo;s about the journey, the lessons learned along the way, and the stories we gather. It\u0026rsquo;s about exploring the fascinating world of technology and beyond. But most importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s about usâ€”our shared experiences, challenges, and dreams.\nThank you for being here, and I look forward to embarking on this adventure together.\nWarmly,\nDzmitry Hramyka\n","permalink":"https://gromdimon.github.io/posts/2024/02/18/what-this-blog-is-about/","tags":null,"title":"What this blog is about?"},{"categories":null,"content":" Summary Working as a Software Engineer at CUBI ðŸ’» Studying bioinformatics at FU-Berlin ðŸ§¬ Obtain knowledge in the field of ML ðŸ‘¾ Active, peaceful, hardworking ðŸš€ Education B.Sc. in Bioinformatics Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin\nOct 2022 â€“ Present\nDuring my studies at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, I\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on an in-depth exploration of bioinformatics, bridging the gap between biology and computer science.
